# WIN-MIN-PE
What I built will be put here
This PE will be named after **MIN PE**.
This PE is completely based on the ADK of Microsoft. It is designed to give you an experience that is closest to the original version of WinPE. We have done our best to add all the function packages that are suitable for changing PE. After installing the ADK package on the computer, we can change and customize it. At the same time, we will also give corresponding production commands to give some instructions for the official documents of Microsoft.
DO NOT COMPARE THIS PE WITH MOST PE ON THE MARKET! Because Microsoft has the following restrictions on WinPE:
Windows PE is not a general-purpose operating system. It cannot be used for any purpose other than deployment and recovery. After 72 hours of continuous use, it will automatically stop running the shell and restart. During this period, it cannot be configured. More restrictions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/winpe-intro?view=windows-10) 
**Note: The recent configuration commands will be based on Windows 10 ADK, and the configuration commands based on Windows 11 will also be introduced shortly**
此PE在此以后，将以**MIN PE**为名。
此PE完全基于Mirosoft的ADK打造，旨在给您一个E最为贴近原版的WinPE的体验，已经竭尽所能，将所有合适于改PE的功能包全部已经加上，可以在电脑上安装ADK包以后，进行对其更改与自定义，同时，也会给出相应的制作命令，以对于Microsoft官方的文档进行一些指示。
请勿将此PE与市面上的大多数PE作比较，因为Microsoft官方对于WinPE具有以下限制：
Windows PE 并不是常规用途操作系统。 除部署和恢复外，它不能用于其他任何目的。在连续使用 72 小时后，它会自动停止运行 shell 并重启。 在此期间，不可进行配置。更多限制在[这里](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/winpe-intro?view=windows-10) 
**注：近期的配置命令会基于Windows 10 ADK,基于Windows 11的配置命令不久也会介绍**
**默认语言为英语或中文简体**
